{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Productionized the company tailored generative AI chatbot with AWS
        hosted large language model and retrieval-augmented generation
        \item Built automation for AWS Lambda for Compass generative AI
        product to move towards continuous integration and deployment
        \item Built the backend service to facilitate the generative AI
        chatbot orchestration
        \item Created the custom AWS SageMaker service to automate the machine
        learning models in cloud environment
        \item Migrated on-premises machine learning models to Amazon Web
        Services with continuous integration and delivery
        \item Built new claim adjudication machine learning model to identify
