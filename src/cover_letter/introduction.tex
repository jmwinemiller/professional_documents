        I am applying for the position of Senior Machine Learning Engineer.\ My CV and
        resume with detailed experience\ is available with the QR codes at the
        bottom of this letter.\ Based on the job description, I am interested in
        hearing about your company since I have previous work experience in
        automation of machine learning lifecycle workflows implementing toolsets
        to manage volatility in large datasets with a high volume of transactions.
        If you have a moment, I would love to ask you more questions around the
        toolsets and type of projects I might be running if hired.\\

        And, if you have any questions about my resume, feel free to reach out over
        email, LinkedIn, or call me directly at my phone number.\\
        \vspace*{0.1 in}
        Hope to hear from you soon,\\
