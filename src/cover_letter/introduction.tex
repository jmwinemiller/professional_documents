    To whom it may concern,\\
    \\
    I am applying for the position of Machine Learning Engineer.\ My CV and
    resume with detailed experience\ is available with the QR codes at the
    bottom of this letter.\ Based on the job description, I am interested in
    hearing about your company since I have previous work experience in
    automation of machine learning lifecycle workflows implementing toolsets
    to manage volatility in large datasets with a high volume of transactions.
    If you have a moment, I would love to ask you more questions around the
    toolsets and type of projects I might be running if hired.\\
    \\
    And, if you have any questions about my resume, feel free to reach out over
    email, LinkedIn, or call me directly at my phone number.\\
    \\
    Hope to hear from you soon,\\
    \\
